      explanation: "CLINICAL RATIONALE: Fructose 2,6-bisphosphate (F2,6-BP) is synthesized by the bifunctional enzyme PFK-2 in response to elevated insulin/glucagon ratios. F2,6-BP binds allosterically to PFK-1, shifting the enzyme from the low-affinity T state to the high-affinity R state, even in the presence of physiologic inhibitory ATP concentrations."

      options: [
        "Km increases (moves closer to zero on the 1/[S] axis), while Vmax remains unchanged",
        "Km remains unchanged, while Vmax decreases",
        "Both Km and Vmax decrease proportionally with parallel slope",
        "Km decreases, while Vmax increases"
      ],
      correctIndex: 0,
      explanation: "CLINICAL RATIONALE: Competitive inhibitors reversibly bind the active substrate-binding site. High substrate concentrations displace the inhibitor, meaning Vmax remains achievable. However, higher substrate is required to reach half-maximal velocity, resulting in an increased apparent Km."

      explanation: "CLINICAL RATIONALE: 2,4-DNP acts as an uncoupling agent by shuttling protons directly across the inner mitochondrial membrane, collapsing the electrochemical proton motive force without passing through ATP synthase (Complex V). Energy is lost as heat (hyperthermia), while the respiratory chain accelerates oxygen consumption in an attempt to restore the gradient."
